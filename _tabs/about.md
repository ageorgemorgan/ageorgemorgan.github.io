I'm an applied mathematician with a strong interest in environmental and climate science. I received a PhD in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 2024: the main focus of my PhD research was the analysis of partial differential equations, but I'm also very interested in scientific computing, numerical analysis, optimization, and applied mathematics in general. 

This blog is a way for me to share some of the teaching and self-study materials I've developed over the past few years in a more accessible way. The content consists of a mix of theoretical and computational topics :)
